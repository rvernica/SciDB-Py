NOTE
====

This is the **legacy** version of the SciDB-Py library. GitHub pull
requests are still accepted for the previous versions, but the code is
not actively maintained. The current version of the SciDB-Py library
is **16.9.1**. This version has been released in *September 2017* and
has been rewritten entirely from scratch. This version is **not
compatible** with the previous versions of the library. The
documentation for the current version is available at `SciDB-Py
documentation <http://paradigm4.github.io/SciDB-Py/>`_

The ``stable`` branch exists only for the legacy SciDB-Py
documentation to be generated at
http://scidb-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ The legacy SciDB-Py version
is in the ``legacy`` branch. The latest SciDB-Py version is in the
``master`` branch.

SciDB-py: Python Interface to SciDB
===================================
SciDB-py is a full-featuered Python interface to SciDB.  It's goal is to
allow users to utilize the power of SciDB_ from Python, using a familiar
and intuitive numpy-like syntax.  For more information, see the
SciDB-Py Documentation_.

Requirements
------------
SciDB-Py requires a working SciDB_ installation, as well as a
Shim_ network interface connected to the instance.  It requires
Python 2.6-2.7 or 3.3.

Package Dependencies
--------------------
SciDB-Py has several Python package dependencies:

NumPy_
    tested with version 1.7.

Requests_
    tested with version 2.7.
    (Note: known failures exist when used with requests version < 2)
    Required for using the Shim interface to SciDB.

Pandas_ (optional)
    tested with version 0.10.
    Required only for importing/exporting SciDB arrays
    as Pandas Dataframe objects.

SciPy_ (optional)
    tested with versions 0.10-0.12.
    Required only for importing/exporting SciDB arrays
    as SciPy sparse matrices.

Test Dependencies
-----------------
Mock_
    Required for some tests

Installation
------------

NOTE for different versions of SciDB
The master branch of this repository tracks the latest release of SciDB.
To get a version of SciDB-Py that works with SciDB version 15.7 or older, choose the ``scidb15.7`` branch.

Installation steps

The latest release of ``scidb-py`` can be installed from the Python package index::

   pip install scidb-py

Install the development package directly from Github with::

    pip install git+http://github.com/paradigm4/scidb-py.git

The latest release of ``scidb-py`` can be installed from the github "http://github.com/paradigm4/scidb-py", "master" branch by downloading the code and typing::

    python setup.py install

Depending on how your Python installation is set up, you
